In this project I want to use the HTML skills I learned in the past days.
I will create a Website with about a recipe or maybe two recipes, I think I have to read the instructions again.

In the past days I learned how to create the "boilerplate" of HTML and how to make lists, paragraphs and how to emphasise words.

I also learned to add pictures and links to a website.

But this isnt only about html for me, i also want to keep in touch with git so that i can incorporate it in my skillset.

I think thats enough for now.

En Hund im BÃ¼roo?
